                <p>Content marketing trends are changing every year. And with each year passing, users are becoming more
                  comfortable and adept with the internet. As a content marketer, you need to gear up with the changing
                  expectations of your audience. Assessing your target audience and taking note of their preferences and
                  likings must be one of your first tasks as a content marketer in 2022.</p>
                <p>For the past two years, content marketers have observed a drastic level of change in finding the
                  presence of active readers online. Content marketers have been essentially triggered to cater to areas
                  like remote learning, improving the online shopping experience, and providing engaging avenues for
                  entertainment and information to the audience.</p>
                <p>With people spending more time on the internet, writing for webinars and podcasts has become a
                  routine practice in the life of a content marketer. In the waves of digital transformation, content
                  marketers not just have the important opportunity but also the responsibility to understand the
                  changing dynamics of the digital market.</p>
                <p>To deal with this, we have curated a list of 5 content marketing trends to follow in 2022 as follows:
                </p>
                <h2>1. Growing importance of interactive content</h2>
                <p>2022 will observe buyers making a crucial purchase decision based on the experiences and information
                  available to them on the internet. Interactive content helps in garnering the attention of the
                  audience by providing them with quick access to information.</p>
                <p>The content marketing industry has expectedly crossed over $400
                    billion mark by the year 2021. The internet is full of blogs, articles, videos, images, and
                  whatnot for literally every subject and topic one can think of. In such a scenario, finding the
                  content gap can be a herculean task.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                <p>For your content copies to stand out, your content must bring in essence the answers to the questions
                  which your users demand. Creating hyper-engaging content is however not easy. Plus, the audience may
                  demand convenient answers at times and may simply not be interested in finding your lengthily worded
                  content. This is where the role of interactive content shines in bringing quick and effective answers
                  to the questions.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The important benefit of using interactive content is that it captures data in a visually aesthetic
                  format. This enables the understanding of the readers, who can then quickly make inferences.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The other significant advantage of interactive content is that it helps in stimulating brand
                    loyalty. Interactive content helps in winning the trust of the readers.</li>
                  <li>They provide the readers the incentive to come back and forth to the authorâ€™s platform to stay in
                    touch with what he or she has to offer next. Interactive content helps in shaping the perception of
                    the audience.</li>
                  <li>On and on, interactive content provides your reader a ready opportunity to become loyal to your
                    brand or business.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>2. Build your Content Marketing Strategy with focus on intent</h2>
                <p>Understanding the real-time needs of the audience is going to be the key in 2022 for the success of
                  all your content marketing initiatives. Search engines like Google and Bing have been working for
                  years to smoothen and improve the experience of the visitors on their website.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Focusing on user intent must be your topmost priority in 2022 before writing a content piece.
                    Capturing the intent allows the author to have an understanding of what their audience is searching
                    about. This way, they have the opportunity to create just the content which matches their needs.
                  </li>
                  <li>Intent is considered to be very important from the standpoint of relevance as per the practices of
                    SEO. The emphasis on writing for intent is also increasing with the growing prominence of
                    voice-based searches (link here).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are basically four types of user
                    intent which the content marketers can aim for producing and marketing their copies. These are:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Informational</li>
                  <li>Transactional</li>
                  <li>Navigational</li>
                  <li>Commercial</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Understanding the user intent for a query or content piece can also help you to navigate to the
                  specific interests of the reader and help them connect with your content better.&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>3. Increasing focus on Account Based Marketing</h2>
                <p>The Internet is a wide pool of blogs, articles, and all other forms of content pieces. In recent
                  years, marketers have fortunately understood the power of content marketing for brand building
                  exercises. Adopting an ABM approach in 2022 will help the brands to focus on creating quality content
                  that is appealing and relevant to the audience.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Account Based Marketing is the dedicated approach of making the optimal use of the resources to
                    get the most value from your marketing initiatives. It is directly aligned with the need for
                    increasing conversion rate and increasing the quality of leads. With accounts based marketing, the
                    focus of the business organisation is to ensure the Return on Investment by making the brand an
                    intrinsic part of an individualâ€™s life.</li>
                  <li>The focus of accounts based marketing is to focus on improving the health of the marketing
                    campaigns by improving their efficiency. What it means for the content marketers is that they need
                    stellar content which not only sticks to the mind of the audience but is also crucial in â€“</li>
                </ul>
                <ol>
                  <li>Reducing bounce rate</li>
                  <li>Improving click through rate</li>
                  <li>Increasing traffic</li>
                  <li>Driving conversions</li>
                  <li>Generating lead</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>4. Focusing on analytics will help you become the winner</h2>
                <p>Search engines are loaded with thousands of results for any given search topic. Content marketing is
                  the new tech age of Google has become one of the important marketing channels to help businesses build
                  their brands.</p>
                <p>A lot of effort goes into making any content. Writers and marketers have the responsibility to
                  understand that they cannot throw up any content on the internet and expect to garner engagement,
                  traffic, and conversions.</p>
                <p>The use of analytics in 2022 is going to be of esteemed importance in helping the brands to find
                  content gaps and watch for what is in trend. This way, marketers stay on top of the shifting
                  priorities and give their content a unique angle with a sense of empathy for the audience.</p>
                <p>Data-driven approach to writing content can help you get a long way to help your content stand out
                  and maintain its relevance for a long-long time.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>5. Growing importance of VR in tech content marketing</h2>
                <p>The growing importance of Virtual Reality in the tech world has made it one of the disruptive
                  technologies for all industries. VR gives an immersive virtual experience for the users to interact.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As per the report released by Forbes, the spending on VR &amp; AR technology is expected to
                    increase by 78.5% this year in comparison with the previous year. This indicates the pressing need
                    for content marketers to develop necessary strategies in making the experience of using the
                    technology more engaging and immersive.</li>
                  <li>While writing for VR, one has to keep in mind that the audience for the platform is atypical. Such
                    users want to enhance their knowledge and want an encouraging experience through visuals and videos.
                  </li>
                  <li>Your storytelling exercises for such a medium must be spot on to garner the appeal and trust of
                    the users. Marketers need to keep in mind that they must win the need for creating fascination in
                    the minds of their audience. The traditional concepts of content writing and marketing are just not
                    enough to suit the needs of the modern age VR users<br>&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For VR users, these are the driving factors that will lead them to consider the value for your
                  content:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Sense of personalisation</strong> â€“ For VR users, a sense of personalisation is the key to
                    deriving the best values from using VR. Creators must keep in mind that they need to blur the
                    difference between the real and the virtual world and hence create killer content to engage their
                    audience better.</li>
                  <li><strong>Solutions to the challenges</strong> â€“ VR users are interested in consuming content in a
                    more informative yet surreal way. Viewers may be interested in exploring any product or maybe
                    encouraged to find answers to the complex problems.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tap into your audienceâ€™s interest to find what works</strong> â€“ It is important to
                    consider that writing for VR essentially means that the interests of your audience are super
                    important. You cannot engage your audience in this ultra-interactive platform unless they are not
                    excited to hear what you have to say. Tap into trends and discover what your audience loves to build
                    your brand message.</li>
                  <li><strong>Draw a compelling narrative</strong> â€“ It is important for content marketers to draw their
                    narratives in a structured manner. With your narratives, the focus must be on winning the trust of
                    your audience. You can do this by adding an emotional element to your story or by narrating
                    real-life experiences to catch and hold the attention of your audience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Final Notesâ€¦</h2>
                <p>Pandemic has caused a lot of brands to pivot their marketing strategies for finding effective and
                  proven ways of associating with personas. Content marketing in this respect has important potential in
                  catering to the changing preferences of the audience by conversing with them.&nbsp; Content marketing
                  is one of the proven ways for brands to build trust with their audience. It gives them the platform to
                  creatively connect and engage with their audience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Content marketing in 2022 is the extension of the trends and developments we have been observing from
                  the past two years. Writers and marketers need to gear up to the changing trends in the world of
                  business vis a vis content marketing. This will help them remain focused to increase the relevance and
                  growth of their business and website.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
