                  Pinterest, it is no longer feasible for businesses to ignore the potential of visual searches.&nbsp;

                  presence on platforms like Pinterest can open a range of unexplored possibilities as the popularity of
                  these platforms will continue to rise.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>3. The trend of Social Commerce</h3>
                <p>Social commerce trend
                  has been an important development as the business integrates their ecommerce services with social
                  media. The research finding of Statista indicates that the trend of social commerce will keep
                  increasing till 2025. Furthermore, influencer marketing has been a game-changer for brands to engage
                  with their audience meaningfully.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>4. Optimizing for Voice Search<br>&nbsp;</h3>
                <p>Voice Search is yet another domain where businesses now need to focus more! The rise of consumer
                  devices like Alexa has led to a defining change in the world of technology. Voice searches are
                  definitive and provide users with the most relevant search results. Furthermore, they bring an
                  important opportunity in terms that they are user-friendly and can bring kids and elders to the

                  effective use of the location data. Small shop owners like grocery store owners, laundry services, and

                  information provide businesses with effective and personalized solutions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2><strong>Ways of building your Business Presence Online&nbsp;</strong></h2>

                  online. Building your effective online marketing strategy must catch an important part of your
                  attention. As per the data released by Sprout Social, almost
                  84.9% of people make their buying decision only when they have seen the brand multiple times.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>Marketers hence need to explore the minds of the smart audience of 2022 to turn them into a buyer.
                  This only becomes possible when marketers have an active online presence to meet their audience where
                  they spend their time the most. If you haven’t already decided on an online marketing strategy for
                  2022, then here’s how you can do it:<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>1. Build an intriguing website</h3>
                <p>Building an intriguing and super engaging website
                  is the first of many steps to get started. Building websites has become important for businesses in
                  times of search results. Websites are the preferred mediums for the audience to know about your
                  business. The fact that 88% of online consumers are less inclined to return to the website is a real
                  eye-opener!&nbsp;</p>
                <p>But, building websites is not as complicated as it sounds. On the brighter side, getting your website
                  built is one of the sure-shot methods of increasing your conversion rate. Websites give you the
                  privilege of combining all your brand props in one place. The visitors on your website can then take
                  it forward from there to become part of the buyer’s journey.<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>2. Create your social media strategy<br>&nbsp;</h3>
                <p>As a business owner, you cannot afford to ignore the importance of social media in current times.
                  There are currently 3.78 billion social media users spread across various social media channels.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>That is, nearly half of the world’s population is using these platforms on an everyday basis, and
                  brands have to figure out a way to use this medium. Social media platforms are active forums of
                  discussion. They provide the businesses with the precise opportunity to tell their brand values and
                  inspire the audience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>3. Give your brand an identity</h3>
                <p>Brands have to humanize their experience of interacting with the audience. Catching the pulse of your
                  audience is the key to providing them with an engaging experience. Giving your brand an identity helps
                  in winning the trust of your consumers and clients.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Besides, as a marketer, having a brand identity helps you to remain motivated in positioning your
                  brand in a better manner. In the times when the audience is moving away from the conventional
                  experience of buying ad copies of brands, having a brand identity really helps! Your brand identity
                  can help you in bringing forward enticing and credible stories.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>4. Improve your online presence by acing the art of visual&nbsp;</h3>
                <p><br>If you haven’t yet figured out a way of creating a visual impact on the minds of your audience,
                  it's best you get started with it right away. Images, typography, and illustrations can bring interest
                  and excitement to even some of your most mundane subjects. A picture is indeed worth a thousand
                  words.&nbsp;<br>Marketers need to start communicating their brand stories with the right strokes of
                  aesthetic values. It is a proven fact that visual appeal has a lasting impression on an individual’s
                  mind. The other important benefit is that imagery really sells. Visual content helps in creating a
                  psychological appeal and converting your prospects into customers instantly.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>5. Invest in SEO</h3>
                <p>Search Engine Optimisation is one of the most important reasons for why online marketing is so
                  effective. Optimizing your website for Google is absolutely necessary, especially if you run an
                  ecommerce website. Investments made on SEO are way less as compared to the spending made on
                  advertisements.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Optimizing your website for search engine rankings has an important benefit of driving organic
                  visitors to your website. The best way of building your SEO strategy for 2022 would be to focus more
                  on context and less on hacks. As it is rightly said, experience is the new social currency in the
                  digital age.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>To Conclude...</h2>
                <p>Having a dedicated online marketing strategy is important. It not only allows you to bring more
                  business but also helps you remain connected with your audience. The never-ending benefits of online
                  marketing make it necessary for your businesses to establish a brand presence online in 2022. The best
                  way to make use of this opportunity is to choose a multi-channel marketing strategy to maximize your
                  reach with the audience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
