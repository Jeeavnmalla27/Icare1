                <p>Video marketing can be simply referred to as the marketing strategy for communicating with your
                  audience with the help of videos. For brands and businesses, this concept is not new. The rise of
                  internet users on various video platforms has been exceptional.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Marketers need to stir their content marketing strategy for creating engaging videos. There are
                  numerous social media platforms where videos can create an impact. Platforms like YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn,
                  Instagram, Vimeo, and others, have their own niche of audience.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With video marketing, your business can interest your personas by telling your brand story in a more
                  personalised and engaging manner. Video stories and live streams open up an all-new range of
                  opportunities for your business. These resonate with your audience and help your business become an
                  important part of their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>What are the advantages of video marketing for my business?&nbsp;</h3>
                <p>A picture is indeed worth a thousand words. A video, however, is undoubtedly even more valuable as it
                  combines the power of both – words as well as images! If done right, then video marketing is one of
                  the most effective marketing strategies that serve your audience a wide range of purposes.&nbsp;</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Video marketing attracts the eyeballs of the viewers and even serves the possibility of making the
                    brand message viral.&nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Video as a medium has the advantage of reaching a much wider base audience. Video messages create
                    a much more engaging impact for your audience.&nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Video marketing helps in building rapport with your audience.</li>
                  <li>Video marketing services can serve a large number of purposes for your brand. Client testimonials,
                    live stream, or a brand advertisement clip - a video answers the questions of your audience.</li>
                  <li>Video marketing puts your brand to action and delivers a large sum of values in a very short span
                    of time.&nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Videos as a medium are a forward-facing strategy to market your brands and products.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>&nbsp;Discussed below are the important reasons why your business must choose to have a dedicated
                  video marketing strategy.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>Importance of video marketing for your business&nbsp;</h3>
                <h4>1. Video content improves the chances of ranking your content:</h4>
                <p>Videos have an important impact in maximising the presence of your website’s content. Videos help
                  in bringing your content to the top position on search engine ranking pages.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Dwell time is one of the important ranking factors of Google. It is important for marketers to
                  consider this factor to improve their chances of ranking their content.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Dwell time refers to the amount of time that any searcher on Google spends on any search result
                  before returning back to the search engine ranking pages. Video content helps in improving the chances
                  of ranking by bringing a bump to this metric.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>As per the report published by HubSpot, 80% of marketers agree that video increases the dwell time of
                  any website. Further, as per the data published by Mist Media, an average user on the internet spends
                  about 88% of the time more on a website that contains the video.</p>
                <p>All this points to the fact that any website content with video has more chances of ranking. Videos
                  facilitate the perceptions of the audience better and are more desirable.</p>
                <h4>&nbsp; 2. Video content is especially useful for B2B businesses aiming for targeted reach :</h4>
                <p>Video content has much more value attached to them than compared to the other forms of content. B2B
                  businesses target a more specific reach with business executives and decision-makers for whom the
                  decision-making exercise is much complicated.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Videos help in bringing targeted reach by being the preferred choice of business executives. For such
                  executives, trust is an important variable in basing their decision-making exercise. A study made by
                  HighIQ reveals interesting facts, with 59 percent of the senior executives agreeing that they would
                  prefer videos more than compared to texts.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the use of video content helps the viewers to learn about products or services in a
                  better manner as video content is more demonstrative and straightforward.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>3. Video marketing boosts information retention for your audience :&nbsp;</h4>
                <p>As a user, you are more likely to retain only 10% of the information after three days of consuming
                  information. In contrast to this, video content has more chances of getting retained by an individual.
                  The average retention age of a video message is three days. This is surprisingly more than 65%
                  compared to the texts.</p>
                <p>Videos are a go-to choice for the users, and they help in increasing the confidence of the users. As
                  a result, values communicated with the help of video messages are more likely to remain in the memory
                  of the audience.</p>
                <p>Research made by Forrester indicates that a single minute of video has a worth of 1.8 million words.
                  This highlights the importance of video marketing is not just boosting but also reinforcing the image
                  of your brand in the minds of the audience.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>4. Video SEO helps in creating more backlinks to your website:</h4>
                <p>One of the major advantages of video marketing is the fact that they are a rich source of traffic for
                  your websites. Videos help in bringing more backlinks to your website as they can be shared easily
                  across different platforms.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, video marketing provides the users with the opportunity to like, share and engage in an
                  interactive exercise of leaving comments on platforms like YouTube. Backlinks achieved in this manner
                  are naturally of good quality. This hence helps you to increase the authority and quality of your
                  website.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Another interesting fact to consider is that keyword search results in the video streaming platforms
                  are more refined and prioritise the factor of user engagement. Thus with engaging video content, your
                  business has an easy chance to showcase its videos on the top of search results on YouTube and thus on
                  Google. This way you also have the chance of staying at the top of your competition.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>5. Video content increases the conversion rate for your website:</h4>
                <p>Video content has a proven impact in increasing the conversion rate of your business. As per a
                  report, video content helps in increasing the conversion rate by up to 46 percent.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Video content helps in bringing a face to your brand's message. Video content improves your
                  conversion rate by reaching your target audience in a more focused manner.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Consumers are hence more induced to make clicks on redirects and product pages. Video marketing
                  improves the reputation of your brand. They use the storytelling format to portray your brand in a
                  positive light.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>How to develop a video marketing strategy?</h3>
                <p>To successfully implement a video marketing content strategy, it is important that you take a guided
                  approach to reflect on the goals and objectives. Your video marketing must be actionable and create a
                  powerful impact on the minds of your audience. Your videos must establish a personal connection with
                  them and add to the value of your audience.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The following ways can help you a long way in exploring the medium for your marketing initiatives if
                  you haven’t already.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>1. Create your customer persona :</h4>
                <p>Your chances of creating compelling video content rise tremendously as you focus more on creating
                  personas.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>This can help you create a more personalised experience for your users and maintain your brand tone
                  accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Creating personas can help your brand in dealing with the expectations of your customers by drawing a
                  clear picture on the table. Your ideal customer persona can help you know about the age group,
                  interests, buying habits, and others.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With this in mind, you can target the expectations of your audience and cater to their best
                  interests.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>2. Create a dedicated video content calendar:</h4>
                <p>Building timelines is the key to ensuring that you put up the best video marketing strategy and
                  achieve the desired levels of engagement.</p>
                <p>Preparing a video marketing plan can be a tedious task. One has to take into account multiple factors
                  for creating a compelling experience for their audience.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Preparation of video script, lighting setups, editing guidelines are just some of the few efforts
                  that go into making a video film. Having a systematic video calendar can help you get a long way in
                  creating videos efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>3. Choose your platform judiciously&nbsp;</h4>
                <p>When preparing a video marketing strategy, one of the first steps for marketers must be to understand
                  their audience. This can help them decide the platform which they must target for reaching their
                  audience. Choosing a suitable platform helps in making your decisions in a wise manner.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Creating platform-specific video content can help in increasing the authenticity of your message. For
                  instance, the video marketing strategy for a 30 second YouTube Short has to be different in comparison
                  to a 30 minute documentary on your YT channel.</p>
                <p>A platform-oriented video marketing strategy thus helps your content to remain 'relevant' for your
                  audience as well as the platforms. There are multiple video streaming options that can be appropriate
                  for the users and bring in rewarding results for your brand.</p>
                <h4>4. Set clarity about what is the video about&nbsp;</h4>
                <p>Your video marketing strategy can drain a lot of your resources if not planned strategically.
                  Marketers need to have clarity about what their video is about. They need to define their target
                  audience and plan their messages correctly to connect with the audience.</p>
                <p>For instance, a brand endorsing its product via video marketing can make the best use of video
                  testimonials. This can help the brand to go full length in showcasing its product features and
                  benefits in an engaging manner.&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>5. Make the choice of video distribution outlets and make videos for the platform</h4>
                <p>Finding the right channel of distribution is important for the delivery of the perfect content to
                  your audience. There are a lot of video distribution channels where you can leverage the presence of
                  your audience to promote your brand.</p>
                <p>Videos can be shared on your website as well as can be shared over emails. They can be uploaded on
                  Youtube where the audience is more general, as well as can be shared on Instagram stories.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Marketers need to identify their niche and prepare their video marketing strategy accordingly.
                  Businesses need to keep exploring these platforms and assess where their audience engages
                  better.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3>In conclusion…</h3>
                <p>Video marketing has hence important sets of benefits associated with them. They are a rich source for
                  lead generation for your business. As per Hubspot</a> &nbsp;:–</p>
