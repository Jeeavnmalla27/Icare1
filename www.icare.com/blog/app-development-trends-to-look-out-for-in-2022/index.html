                <p>Technological shifts and developments have contributed to increased efficiency in more elegant ways
                  in literally all spheres of human life! This has led to a massive impact on people in every possible
                  way.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Have you tried using the MyHeritage app or a similar filter - the Dynamic Photo Filter? To whoever
                  said technology takes away the emotional and human values from things got a setback with these two.
                  Several people have been using the app on pictures of their deceased relatives.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In this article, we will cover app development trends that are likely to create a massive impact in
                  2022. Look out for these trends because they will come in at break-neck speed and it is therefore
                  essential to be acquainted with them.&nbsp;</p>
                <h2><strong>Top 8 App Development Trends&nbsp;</strong></h2>
                <p>Here are top 8 app development trends that are likely to have a considerable impact in the way the
                  tech industry influences and shapes the rest of the sectors in 2022:-&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><strong>1. Internet of Things (IoT)</strong></h3>
                <p>Since its introduction, one of the most notable and dynamic trends has been that of the Internet of
                  Things. It is an ever-growing and constantly changing industry phenomenon and is likely to continue to
                  create newer and more innovative dynamics in the coming year. The Internet of Things already gave us
                  products like Amazon Dash button, Philips lighting system, August doorbell cam, among several
                  others.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The use of IoT is likely to bring in drastic changes when it comes to lavish living and improved
                  lifestyle. The Internet of Things is especially likely to have considerable impact in the Healthcare and
                  Education sectors in 2022. It will be interesting to know what IoT has in store for us very soon!</p>
                <h3><strong>2. 5G Network&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p>Yet another awaited trend in 2022, the 5G network is one to look out for. People all over the world
                  are extremely excited about the 5G network and look forward to trying out the connection for an
                  effortless and seamless experience. While the 5G network has already shown positive results when used
                  in iPhone 12, the world is interested in knowing if the adaptability of the network is just as good
                  with other products.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The 5G networks are expected to surpass the 4G networks as these are expected to be 100X faster than
                  the latter! Furthermore, the 5G network is one of the most awaited trends of 2022 because of the
                  considerably low latency and higher stability it has to offer. The potential benefits of the
                  technology are enough to influence its use by global organisations worldover for 2022!&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><strong>3. Blockchain&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p>Cryptocurrencies and digital investments are likely to be one of the most prominent and used methods
                  of payment in 2022. And executing these transactions has only been possible because of blockchain
                  technology. So coming year is likely to roll out plenty of blockchain-based apps for smartphone users
                  to continue using Ethereum, Doge, Bitcoin, and whatnot!&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The tech geeks have already started exploring the intricacies of blockchain technology to look for
                  answers to questions related to some of the most pressing matters and concerns - protection of
                  sensitive information and bulk transactions to a number of sources. Blockchain technology has been
                  successful in directly connecting the providers and users to ensure no breach of sensitive data but
                  evolving times demand innovative solutions. So look out for the latest developments in this
                  trend.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><strong>4. Biometric Authentication&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p>While this may not be a completely new and upcoming trend, biometric authentication for apps,
                  especially smartphone apps is likely to see a considerable boost. Biometric authentication may also
                  replace the traditional ways of creating login pins and passwords for functions such as logging into
                  your accounts, unlocking devices, accessing bank details, and more.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>According to research and ongoing trends, the majority of biometric authentication projects are
                  likely to be focused on integrating face recognition for using apps on multiple devices. Biometric
                  authentication has been one of the most convenient trends due to the high level of security and the
                  ease of use it ensures irrespective of apps and devices. It is therefore going to be interesting
                  seeing what new shape this trend develops into in 2022.</p>
                <h3><strong>5. Cloud Integration&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p>Cloud integration technology is an immersive technology that allows its users to store important data
                  in the connected cloud storage. It is an integration feature</a> that
                  has gained popularity over the course of the past 4 to 5 years. While cloud integration is already
                  being used for securing data, 2022 is likely to see cloud integration being used for customer support
                  by businesses. This can help in quicker and more efficient resolution of client issues and queries.
                </p>
                <p>In 2022, cloud integration is set to make its way to mobile applications to conveniently secure the
                  data in the device. While cloud integration may be used for apps that can be easily installed and
                  uninstalled, there are companies that plan to develop their devices and in-built apps that cannot be
                  manually deleted with cloud integration to cut down the number of steps for data safety.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><strong>6. Enterprise Mobile Applications&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p>The use of Enterprise Mobile Applications has gained momentum and is likely to be one of the most
                  prominent app development trends in 2022. The apps are especially common among small businesses and
                  entrepreneurs setting up their endeavours. These apps help companies in connecting with their
                  employees through a singular network.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>By enhancing the internal communication in a firm, these applications can contribute to the overall
                  productivity of the company immensely. And with the majority of functions being carried out through
                  digital channels and mediums as a result of the pandemic. According to a report by Forbes, the number
                  of active enterprise mobile applications is likely to increase by 27% in 2022. This can help in
                  tremendously boosting the ROIs and living standards of the employees of the company.&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><strong>7. Beacon Technology&nbsp;</strong></h3>
                <p>While the Beacon technology was introduced back in 2013, it is likely to catch momentum in 2022! This
                  technology is set to be used for mobile app development, especially for retail businesses. Beacons are
                  miniscule wireless transmitters that make use of the Bluetooth technology. These are low energy
                  transmitters that are used for sending signals to other smart devices in the vicinity.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The Beacon technology is set to benefit the consumers as it can provide you with real-time, location
                  specific information and alerts in users’ mobile devices. These are set to manage m-commerce
                  efficiently. Furthermore, businesses are set to benefit from the technology by helping them understand
                  the shopping preferences of their customers better and use the data for creating personalized shopping
                  experiences.</p>
                
                <h2><strong>To Conclude…</strong></h2>
                <p>2022 seems like a promising year in terms of app development trends, especially when they have taken
                  a turn towards empowering user satisfaction and consumer experience. Introducing these trends can help
                  you accelerate your growth with the right kind of digital transformation to enhance your business’s
                  operational efficiency and boost growth!</p>
